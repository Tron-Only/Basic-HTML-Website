🌐 **Basic HTML Website Project**  
Welcome to the **Basic HTML Website** Project! This project is all about learning and applying fundamental HTML skills to build a multi-page website with structured content. 🚀

📋 **Overview**  
This project is part of the [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website) series. The goal is to create a simple, semantic, and clean website using only HTML. I focused on structuring pages such as the homepage, projects, articles, and contact page, following best practices for accessibility and SEO. 🖥️basically, everything you need to build your online presence (without any fancy stuff... for now). 😎

🔧 **Requirements**  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** 🖥️ (because who doesn’t love VS Code?)
- **Live Server Plugin** 🌐 (seriously, this will save your life)
- **Some basic HTML knowledge** 🧠 (I kept it simple, promise!)

🛠️ **How to Use**  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   `git clone <repository-link>`  
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.  
3. Install the Live Server plugin if you don’t have it yet.  
4. Right-click on the homepage (index.html) file and select **Open with Live Server**.  
5. Enjoy exploring the website in the browser! ✨
